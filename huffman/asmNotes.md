##The assembly code is still in development

this line in the above code: cmp esi, [tree]+ebx*2 gives this error: error: comma, decorator or end of line expected, got 43.  How do I fix it

The error you are seeing is likely because of the square brackets around tree. In NASM assembly, square brackets are used to dereference memory addresses. When you write [tree], it means "the value at the memory address pointed to by the tree label".

However, in this case, tree is an array and we want to access a specific element of the array using an offset. To do this, we can use the syntax tree + ebx*2 to compute the address of the desired element.

To fix the error, you can change the line to:

```
cmp esi, [tree + ebx*2]
```

This will compare the value in esi with the value at the memory address computed by adding tree and ebx*2.
